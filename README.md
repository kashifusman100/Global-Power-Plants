# Global-Power-Plants
This project involves analyzing the Global Power Plants data, which contains information on power plants worldwide, including their locations, capacities, primary fuel types, and commissioning years. The analysis aims to uncover trends, insights, and patterns in the global energy landscape.

## Data source:
- global_power_plant_database.csv

## Software:
- Python 3.11
- Visual Studio Code 1.95
- Jupyter Notebook

## Problem Statement
With the global push towards renewable energy and sustainable practices, understanding the distribution, capacity, and trends in power plants is crucial. This project seeks to answer the following questions:
- Which countries have the most power plants?
- What is the distribution of primary fuel types used in power generation?
- What are the average capacities (MW) for different fuel types?
- Where are underperforming plants located, and what factors contribute to this?
- What are the most commonly used fuel types, and how does capacity vary across these types?

## Top 10 Countries with Most Power Plants
The top countries with the most power plants are major industrialized nations, reflecting their energy demands and infrastructure capabilities. The United States leads with 9,833 power plants, followed by China (4,235) and the United Kingdom (2,751). Russia ranks 10th with 545 power plants.

## Underperforming Power Plants

This chart identifies power plants with a capacity of less than 50 MW, considered underperforming. All nine locations of these plants are in economically disadvantaged regions. Underperformance could be attributed to limited energy demands or resource constraints in these regions.

## Commissioning Trend Over the Years
Advancements in technology have enabled higher capacity plants, reflecting a focus on efficiency and scalability. This chart shows the commissioning trends of power plants from 2000 to 2020. While the number of new plants remained steady, their capacities increased significantly during this period.
