# Global-Power-Plants
## Project Description
This project involves analyzing the Global Power Plants data, which contains information on power plants worldwide, including their locations, capacities, primary fuel types, and commissioning years. The analysis aims to uncover trends, insights, and patterns in the global energy landscape.

## Data source:
- global_power_plant_database.csv

## Software:
- Python
- Visual Studio Code
- Jupyter Notebook

## Problem Statement
With the global push towards renewable energy and sustainable practices, understanding the distribution, capacity, and trends in power plants is crucial. This project seeks to answer the following questions:
- Which countries have the most power plants?
- What is the distribution of primary fuel types used in power generation?
- What are the average capacities (MW) for different fuel types?
- Where are underperforming plants located, and what factors contribute to this?
- What are the most commonly used fuel types, and how does capacity vary across these types?

## Top 10 Countries with Most Power Plants
The top countries with the most power plants are major industrialized nations, reflecting their energy demands and infrastructure capabilities. The United States leads with 9,833 power plants, followed by China (4,235) and the United Kingdom (2,751). Russia ranks 10th with 545 power plants.

## Average MW Capacity for Each Fuel Type
Nuclear power, though limited in number, contributes significantly to energy production due to its high capacity. This chart compares the average capacities of different fuel types. Nuclear power plants have the highest average capacity at 2,091 MW, followed by coal (843 MW) and gas (373 MW).

## Underperforming Power Plant Regions

This chart identifies power plants with a capacity of less than 50 MW, considered underperforming. All nine locations of these plants are in economically disadvantaged regions. Underperformance could be attributed to limited energy demands or resource constraints in these regions.

## Commissioning Trend Over the Years
Advancements in technology have enabled higher capacity plants, reflecting a focus on efficiency and scalability. This chart shows the commissioning trends of power plants from 1900 to 2020. While the number of new plants remained steady, their capacities increased significantly from 2000 to 2020.

## Most Used Fuel Types in Power Plants
Despite the shift towards renewable energy, fossil fuels still play a significant role in global power generation. This chart indicates that coal is the most preferred fuel type (26.7%), followed by oil (20.0%) and natural gas (13.3%).

## Capacity Distribution Across Fuel Types
Traditional fossil fuels dominate in terms of capacity, emphasizing their continued importance in meeting global energy needs. A box plot visualizes the capacity distribution for various fuel types. Coal, oil, and natural gas exhibit the highest capacities.

## Key Findings
- The United States, China, and the United Kingdom lead in the number of power plants, reflecting their industrial capacity and energy demands.
- Nuclear power plants have the highest average capacity, underscoring their efficiency in energy production.
- Underperforming power plants are concentrated in economically disadvantaged regions, likely due to lower energy demands and resource limitations.
- While the total number of power plants commissioned has remained steady, their capacities have significantly increased since 2000, reflecting advancements in technology.
- Coal remains the most preferred fuel type, followed by oil and natural gas, despite the rise in renewable energy sources.
- Fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas dominate in terms of capacity, highlighting their ongoing significance in global energy production.
